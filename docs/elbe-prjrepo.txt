NAME
----
elbe-prjrepo - Provides access to the Debian repositories in each project folder.


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'elbe prjrepo download' <project_dir>
'elbe prjrepo upload_pkg' <project_dir> [<debfile> | <dscfile> | <changesfile>]
'elbe prjrepo list_packages' <project_dir>

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Whenever ELBE pbuilder builds a Debian package, it is added to a local Debian
repository which is located in the project folder inside the initvm. Packages in
this repository can then be installed into a root file system. The
`elbe-prjrepo` command allows the user to interact with this repository,
i.e. list, upload and download packages.

OPTIONS
-------

--user <username>::
	Username to use for login (defaults to root).

--pass <password>::
	Password for login (defaults to 'foo').

--retries <N>::
	How many times to retry the connection to the server before giving up
	(default is 10 times, yielding 10 seconds).

COMMANDS
--------

'download' <project_dir>::

Downloads the Debian repository of the project located in <project_dir> to the
host machine.


'upload_pkg' <project_dir> [<debfile> | <dscfile> | <changesfile>]::

Loads a Debian package into the Debian repository of an existing Elbe project in
the initvm. Both binary and source packages are supported. In order to upload a
source package you need to specify the dsc-file in the command as shown above.
The actual source files which are required for the source package need to be
located in the same directory as the dsc-file. The same is true for a changes
file.  The actual files defined in the changes file need to reside in the same
directory.


'list_packages' <project_dir>::

Lists all packages available in the Debian repository of the project.


Example
-------
